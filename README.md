# Climb

A simple project for testing out how to use Shaders in Unity.

There is not much to see, but you'll find a 2D Heatmap with values generated from Perlin Noise.

RGB color values are generated from a simple heatmap image I found, and a simple Python script is used to extract and print them out.
